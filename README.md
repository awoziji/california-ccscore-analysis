# california-ccscore-analysis

[A Los Angeles Times analysis published on Oct. 31, 2016](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-water-conservation-backslide-20161018-snap-htmlstory.html), found that the overwhelming majority of California water districts increased their usage after the state eased its drought restrictions. Some of the most extreme increases were found in inland Northern California, led by the San Juan Water District near Folsom Lake.

How did The Times come to that conclusion? Using the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/datadesk/california-ccscore-analysis/blob/master/analysis.ipynb) in this repository.
